# In some cases, relay might fail to find out the actual machine memory
# therefore it makes the healthcheck fail and events can't be submitted.
# See https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/3330 for more details.
# As a workaround, uncomment the following `health` and `spool` sections:
#
# health:
#  max_memory_percent: 1.0
# spool:
#   envelopes:
#     path: "/tmp/relay-spool-envelopes"
#     max_backpressure_memory_percent: 1.0

# If you have statsd server, you can utilize that to monitor self-hosted Relay.
# To start, uncomment the following `metrics` section and adjust the options as needed.
#
# metrics:
#  statsd: "100.100.123.123:8125" # It is recommended to use IP address instead of domain name
#  prefix: "sentry.relay" # Adjust this to your needs, default is "sentry.relay"
#  sample_rate: 1.0 # Adjust this to your needs, default is 1.0
#  # `periodic_secs` is the interval for periodic metrics emitted from Relay.
#  #  Setting it to `0` seconds disables the periodic metrics.
#  periodic_secs: 5
