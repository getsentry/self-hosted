# Self-Hosted Sentry nightly

Official bootstrap for running your own [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Requirements

* Docker 19.03.6+
* Compose 1.28.0+
* 4 CPU Cores
* 8 GB RAM
* 20 GB Free Disk Space

## Setup

### Customize DotEnv (.env) file

Environment specific configurations can be done in the `.env.custom` file. It will be located in the root directory of the Sentry installation.

By default, there exists no `.env.custom` file. In this case, you can manually add this file by copying the `.env` file to a new `.env.custom` file and adjust your settings in the `.env.custom` file.

Please keep in mind to check the `.env` file for changes, when you perform an upgrade of Sentry, so that you can adjust your `.env.custom` accordingly, if required.

### Installation

To get started with all the defaults, simply clone the repo and run `./install.sh` in your local check-out. Sentry uses Python 3 by default since December 4th, 2020 and Sentry 21.1.0 is the last version to support Python 2.

During the install, a prompt will ask if you want to create a user account. If you require that the install not be blocked by the prompt, run `./install.sh --skip-user-prompt`.

Thinking of not managing this yourself? Check out the [SaaS migration docs](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/migration/) or [contact us](https://sentry.io/from/self-hosted) for help.

Please visit [our documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/) for everything else.

## Tips & Tricks

### Event Retention

Sentry comes with a cleanup cron job that prunes events older than `90 days` by default. If you want to change that, you can change the `SENTRY_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS` environment variable in `.env` or simply override it in your environment. If you do not want the cleanup cron, you can remove the `sentry-cleanup` service from the `docker-compose.yml`file.

### Installing a specific SHA

If you want to install a specific release of Sentry, use the tags/releases on this repo.

We continously push the Docker image for each commit made into [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry), and other services such as [Snuba](https://github.com/getsentry/snuba) or [Symbolicator](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolicator) to [our Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/getsentry) and tag the latest version on master as `:nightly`. This is also usually what we have on sentry.io and what the install script uses. You can use a custom Sentry image, such as a modified version that you have built on your own, or simply a specific commit hash by setting the `SENTRY_IMAGE` environment variable to that image name before running `./install.sh`:

```shell
SENTRY_IMAGE=getsentry/sentry:83b1380 ./install.sh
```

Note that this may not work for all commit SHAs as this repository evolves with Sentry and its satellite projects. It is highly recommended to check out a version of this repository that is close to the timestamp of the Sentry commit you are installing.

### Using Linux

If you are using Linux and you need to use `sudo` when running `./install.sh`, make sure to place the environment variable *after* `sudo`:

```shell
sudo SENTRY_IMAGE=us.gcr.io/sentryio/sentry:83b1380 ./install.sh
```

Where you replace `83b1380` with the sha you want to use.
