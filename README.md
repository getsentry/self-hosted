# Sentry On-Premise

Official bootstrap for running your own [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Requirements

 * Docker 1.10.0+
 * Compose 1.6.0+ _(optional)_

## Up and Running

Assuming you've just cloned this repository, the following steps
will get you up and running in no time!

There may need to be modifications to the included `docker-compose.yml` file to accommodate your needs or your environment. These instructions are a guideline for what you should generally do.

1. `mkdir -p data/{sentry,postgres}` - Make our local database and sentry config directories.
    This directory is bind-mounted with postgres so you don't lose state!
2. `docker-compose run --rm web config generate-secret-key` - Generate a secret key.
    Add it to `docker-compose.yml` in `base` as `SENTRY_SECRET_KEY`. If you get **Invalid interpolation format** error
    remember to escape $ in the key with $$.
3. `docker-compose run --rm web upgrade` - Build the database.
    Use the interactive prompts to create a user account.
4. `docker-compose up -d` - Lift all services (detached/background mode).
5. Access your instance at `localhost:9000`!

Note that as long as you have your database bind-mounted, you should
be fine stopping and removing the containers without worry.

## Securing Sentry with SSL/TLS

If you'd like to protect your Sentry install with SSL/TLS, there are
fantastic SSL/TLS proxies like [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/)
and [Nginx](http://nginx.org/).
